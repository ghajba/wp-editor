### This is a ### simple test file

Here I only test some basic occurrences. This is not a real *test* file, just a simple ***pre-test***.

## Why? ##

I am doing this because I want to ***test*** the default behavior of my application in the mean time while developing.

~~~~~~~~{'language':"java", 'light':'true'}
    This should be a sourcecode at the *end*... nothing ***more***, nothing ***less***.
~~~~~~~~

* a list
* with 2 elements?

text?

@@@ preformatted again?

simple text again
